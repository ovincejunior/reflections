When will you want to create a remote repository instead of keep all your work local?
      One will do that if they are working in collaboration and others need to access this repository. 
      if one needs to access the repository from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	  when collaborated, it is better to have this capacity to pull changes when you feel it is worth it. Otherwise, any work will be reflected in the remote repository and can create more confusion.
